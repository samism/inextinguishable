            <p>I'm an aspiring Software Engineer that's always had a propensity for front-end work. Right now, I'm enamored with Cloud Computing. My interests include Containerization, Container Orchestration, Serverless Architecture, and other aspects of the Software Development Lifecycle. Currently attending the University of Illinois at Springfield, I will be graduating in May of 2019.</p>
            <p>A Chicagoland local, I have worked in low-level politics operating polling stations, worked to redefine Real Estate at <a href="https://www.redfin.com/">Redfin</a>, and have had professional experience interning as a Software Engineer at CDK Global.</p>
            <p>Some of my other interests include pool, fitness, and trying great new eateries.</p>
            <p>I have most recently travelled to <bold>New York</bold>, <bold>Miami, FL</bold> and <bold>Las Vegas, NV!</bold></p>
